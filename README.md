# folder2txt

Convert local folder contents into a single text file with ease. This CLI tool processes all files in a folder and concatenates their contents into a single text file, making it perfect for analysis, documentation, or AI training purposes.

## Features

- üìÅ Process files in any local folder
- üìù Convert folder contents to a single text file
- ‚ö° Automatic binary file exclusion
- üîß Configurable file size threshold
- üíª Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Installation

Install globally via npm:

```sh
npm install --global folder2txt
```

then navigate to the folder you want to convert to a txt file, and run:

```sh
$ folder2txt
```

## Options

```sh
--output, -o     Specify output file path (default: output.txt)
--threshold, -t  Set file size threshold in MB (default: 0.1)
--include-all    Include all files regardless of size or type
--debug         Enable debug mode with verbose logging
--help          Show help

```

## Default Behavior

- Files larger than 100KB are excluded by default

- The output file is created in the current directory and named output.txt
- Files are processed recursively through all subdirectories (excluding the output file‚Äôs directory, node_modules, vendor, .lock files and .git)
- File paths and contents are separated by clear markers
- Relative paths are preserved in the output

## Output Format

The tool generates a text file with this format:

```txt
================================================================================
File: path/to/file.txt
Size: 1.2 KB
================================================================================

[File contents here]

================================================================================
File: another/file.js
